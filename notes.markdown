A friendly guide to starting a security program. Skipping distractions and

# Why are you starting one? (Relate to them)

## Where does security come from
- Compliance / Customer Need (Managing a matrix of customer questionnaires, promises, and negotiation unknowns)
- Paranoid Early Employee (Intuition based approach, maybe based on their experiences or anecdotal stories)
- Board mandate ("Protect our data", 6mos later you present to them, they ask three questions, and you get no feedback)
- Incident (Knee jerk reaction, becoming hyper insulated to just one incident)
- Fear (Buy Everything)
- Some other reason?

## What is actually happening underneath?
- Managing risk

## What risks?
- Now we can begin.
- Risks are the "raw materials" of a security program.
- We need to make a list of them that respects how fluid, unknown, and malleable they are.
- I mentally compare this to organizing artwork. Artwork has specific metrics: Artist, date, dimensions, weight, medium.
- But we do not organize museums this way. We rely on the expertise of a curator. Because it is unknown what the most effective arrangements will be.
- But, they certainly modify them after the fact. Akin to A/B testing. They can locally optimize tactics that improve upon their overall strategy.



## What do they want
- Maturity model to follow
- Best Practices
- Threat Model / Risk Assessment
- Prioritization - ReCalibration
