    # Risk Forecasting
    ### Answering: "Did our security get better?"

    ---

    ## This method is simple and powerful.

    ---

    ## In fact, you're going to measure a risk *right now*.

    ---

    ## It's our "Hello World".

    ---

    ## Think of a *big* risk that you _recently_ tried to mitigate.

    ---
    name: final
    layout: true
    class: left, top, inverse
    ---

    ## Examples:

    --

    ### Customer data is stolen.

    --

    ### Our CEO has malware on their laptop

    --

    ### We are knocked offline because of an incident.

    ---
    template: inverse
    layout: true
    ---

    ## Now, ask yourself:

    ---

    ## 1. Will this occur this year?

    --

    ## 2. What are the odds?

    ---

    ## You don't have to worry about correct answers yet.

    --

    ### We'll take this more seriously later.

    ---

    ## Here's an example answer.

    ---
    ## Scenario:
    ### We are knocked offline because of an incident in the next year.
    ---
    ## Your forecast:
    ### There is a .red[33% chance] that this will happen.

    ---

    ## You're done!
    ### That's it. We have successfully forecasted a risk.

    ---

    ## But this data is worthless unless we know how to use it.

    --

    ### If you are not skeptical so far, you should be.

    --

    ### This forecast is littered with problems.

    ---
    template: final
    layout: false
    ## Why?

    --

    ### Humans are easily overconfident with their knowledge. [Research](https://machinelearnings.co/why-are-we-so-confident-2c3151a6d5d0) agrees.

    --

    ### A [2005 book by Philip E. Tetlock](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715) summarizes over a decade of research showing expert forecasts to be worse than simple, algorithmic approaches.

    --

    ### We are also bad at forecasting risk. Hardly a suprise.

    ---
    template: inverse
    layout: true
    ---

    ### This may be one of the reasons we are so bad at preventing breaches.

    ---

    ## The same researcher (Tetlock) also spearheaded research into individuals [who were effective forecasters](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8).

    ---

    ## These are now well researched subjects, and give insight effective forecasting methods.

    ---

    ## Forecasting is quantifiable.
    ###It is measurable, unlike .red[high] or .green[low].

    ---

    ### (Let's not pretend that we liked color coded risk matrices anyway)

    ---

    ## Rigorous process can measurably improve forecasting.
    ### There are observable methods that make forecasts increasingly reliable.

    ---

    ## We can turn that forecast into data that we can trust.

    --

    ### That .red[33%] value can become a meaningful decision making tool...

    --

    ### ...instead of feeling like a guess.

    ---

    # How do we fix this?

    ---

    ### We must surround the forecast with a _disciplined process_ to increase the value of the forecaster.

    ---

    ### Let's build that process.

    ---

    ## First, let's review another simple example.

    ---

    # An employee is infected with malware.

    ---
    ### You predict...
    ## There is a .red[15%] chance that this will happen.

    ---

    ### Let's review the problems that stop us from taking this data seriously.

    ---

    ### It's not specific enough to forecast. Let's time box it to "this year".

    --

    ## Pick a timeframe.

    ---

    ### Add threat, vector, asset, when you can. These improve for future forecasts.

    --

    ## Be less ambiguous.

    ---
    ### Some examples:

    ---
    ## The CEO is infected by malware delivered by a spearphish in the next 365 days.
    ---
    ## A remote adversary obtains domain admin credentials on our corporate network and exfiltrates executive emails from Outlook within the next year.
    ---
    ## Remote code is successfully executed (RCE) on our production web application by a remote party, and passwords are siphoned out of memory to a remote host in the next month.
    ---
    ## A customer support representative will snoop around in a celebrity's private data this week.
    ---
    ## A worm taking advantage of a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability is propagating through our app and destroying data on black Friday.
    ---
    ## Our service is down for customers due to a Denial of Service attack during Q4.
    ---
    ### These are better, but they don't have to be perfect.

    --

    ### In fact, they may be too specific. We can ease up on that if we want, too.

    --

    ### Picking a good scenario is a lot like agreeing on a problem.

    ---

    ### A well designed scenario is vulnerable to [Fermi's methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) of decomposition.

    ---

    ### Next, we improve the forecaster and improve [Brier scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score).

    --

    ## Calibrate the forecaster's confidence.

    ---

    ### The Brier score measures how trustworthy someone's confidence is.

    --

    ### Someone with a perfect Brier score is *right* when they say they are *right*.

    --

    ### They are *probably wrong* when they say they aren't sure.

    ---
    ### You can measure someone's Brier score pretty easily.

    --

    ### You just have to hold them accountable to their forecasts over time.
    ---
    ### You can quickly sample your own Brier score [here](http://confidence.success-equation.com).
    ---
    ### Go do this, then come back.
    ---
    ## Welcome back!
    ### A [recent study](https://hbr.org/2016/05/superforecasting-how-to-upgrade-your-companys-judgment) shows that training of forecasting techniques, and awareness of one's own confidence can drastically improve forecasting abilities.
    ---
    ## You just practiced a little.
    ---
    ## Your forecasts are now more reliable.
    ---
    ## We can improve this even *more*.
    ---
    ## Let's remove bias from our forecast.
    ### You'd grab some friends, co-workers, experts, etc. Diverse is better.
    ---
    ## Then, we'd calibrate them, too.
    ###<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>

    --

    ### Now we have a group of forecasts we can average together.

    --

    ### Into one forecast.
    ###<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>


    ---
    ### Groups seem to benefit greatly from combined forecasts.
    ---
    ## A fun example.

    --

    ### In 1907, a group of 787 people [correctly guessed the weight of an Ox](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3989.pdf).

    --

    ### This was documented in the book [The Wisdom of Crowds](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706).

    ---

    ## A recent example.

    --

    ### This method was used to combine civilian [forecasters into teams](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/04/02/297839429/-so-you-think-youre-smarter-than-a-cia-agent)...

    --

    ### ...and *beat* national security intelligence analysts...

    --

    ###...who had access to .red[confidential data].

    ---

    ### So, where are we?

    ---

    name: final
    layout: true
    class: left, top, inverse

    ---

    # We have forecasting tools.

    --

    ### We should prefer to forecast specific, time boxed scenarios.

    --

    ### A group of diverse expert forecasts can smoothen out bias, like FUD and overconfidence.

    --

    ### We can be trained to calibrate our Brier scores. [Quickly](http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16511/jdm16511.pdf).

    --

    ### So...

    --

    ## Calibrated experts can forecast the probability of a risk.

    ---
    template: inverse
    layout: true
    ---

    ## We're stil not done.

    --

    ### This is *still not useful*.

    ---

    ### We have improved our ability to forecast, but we can't predict the future.

    ---

    ### We can't know what is written in the cosmic notebook.

    --

    ## It's impossible to know the true probability.

    ---

    ## This doesn't matter.

    --

    ### We're not trying to find a bullseye.

    --

    ### We're just trying to get closer to it.

    ---

    ## This is a matter of accuracy versus *precision*.

    --

    ### Accuracy needs to be close to the true probability. We'll never succeed.

    --

    ### Precision is about reliably creating the same result, even if we're off-center.

    ---

    ### To put this simply...

    --

    ## We may never find the cosmic "bullseye".

    --

    ## Instead, we can track progress towards it.

    ---
    template: final
    layout: true
    ---
    ## Reducing probabilistic risk over time:
    "Attacker obtains keys for destructive AWS IAM permissions this year."

    --

    ### 2016 - Q3: .red[25%]

    --

    ### 2016 - Q4: .red[23%]

    --

    ### 2017 - Q1: .red[16%]

    --

    ### 2017 - Q2: .green[10%]

    --

    ## An increase in confidence against this threat of .green[15%].

    ---

    ## Directionality of confidence is all that matters.

    --

    ### It may be impossible to find an oracle of probability for each risk.

    --

    ### We cannot see this oracle directly...

    --

    ### ...but if a group of people can measure an ox,

    --

    ### Then our forecasts of risk likely share a direction with an oracle of risk.

    --

    ## If there is truth to this, then we have a huge opportunity.

    ---
    template: inverse

    ## We can measure that we're getting better at security.
